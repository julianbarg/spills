	abstract = {Organizational learning takes place through activities performed by individuals, groups, and organizations as they gather and digest information, imagine and plan new actions, and implement change. I examine the learning practices of companies in two industries--nuclear power plants and chemical process plants--that must manage safety as a major component of operations, and therefore must learn from precursors and near-misses rather than exclusively by trial-and-error. Specifically, I analyse the linked assumptions or logics underlying incident reviews, root cause analysis teams, and self-analysis programmes. These logics arise from occupational and hierarchical groups that work on different problems in different ways--for example, anticipation and resilience, fixing and learning, concrete and abstract. In organizations with fragmentary, myopic and disparate understandings of how the work is accomplished, there are likely to be more failures to learn from operating experience, recurrent problems, and cyclical crises. Enhanced learning requires ways to broaden and bring together disparate logics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Dillon2008,
	abstract = {Although organizations appear to learn from obvious failures, we argue that it is harder for them to learn from "near-misses"-events in which chance played a role in averting failure. In this paper, we formalize the concept of near-misses and hypothesize that organizations and managers fail to learn from near-misses because they evaluate such events as successes and thus feel safer about the situation. We distinguish perceived ("felt") risk from calculated statistical risk and propose that lower levels of perceived risk encourage people with near-miss information to make riskier subsequent decisions compared to people without near-miss information. In our first study, we confirm the tendency to evaluate near-misses as successes by having participants rate a project manager whose decisions result in either (a) mission success, (b) near-miss, or (c) failure. Participants (both students and NASA employees and contractors) give similar ratings to managers whose decisions produced near-misses and to managers whose decisions resulted in successes, and both ratings are significantly different from ratings of managers who experienced failures. We suggest that the failure to hold managers accountable for near-misses is a foregone learning opportunity for both the manager and the organization. In our second set of studies, we confirm that near-miss information leads people to choose a riskier alternative because of a lower perceived risk following near-miss events. We explore several alternative explanations for these findings, including the role of Bayesian updating in processing near-miss data. Ultimately, the analysis suggests that managers and organizations are reducing their perception of the risk, although not necessarily updating (lowering) the statistical probability of the failure event. We speculate that this divergence arises because perceived risk is the product of associative processing, whereas statistical risk arises from rule-based processing.},

	abstract = {Although research on organizational misconduct has a long history and a recent increase in popularity, important questions are still unexplored. We review and critique research on misconduct with an emphasis on organizational causes. In addition to reviewing some active areas of research, we also examine less-trodden areas and make suggestions for their development. We find that the definition of misconduct is often implicit and the role of socialcontrol agents in identifying misconduct has been neglected, suggesting a need for more rigor in how researchers define the boundary of misconduct and measure the labeling of misconduct. The spread of misconduct within and among organizations has also seen relatively little attention, as has the spread of the consequences of misconduct, suggesting a need to examine diffusion of misconduct. Finally, organizational misconduct has been an effective context for testing theories on themes such as motivation, control, power, labeling, and status, and will continue to be an important research topic for both its applied value and its theoretical import. {\textcopyright} 2010 Academy of Management.},

Events are critical triggers of institutional transformation and industry evolution. However, they must first become the focus of public attention to have this effect. We draw on a paired case comparison of media coverage of eight nonroutine events affecting the natural environment and the U.S. chemical industry. We employ both deductive and inductive analysis to develop a model and hypotheses to explain two research questions. First, what determines the initial public attention to an event? Second, when and why do certain events attain high and sustained levels of industry attention? A key inference is that whether an event receives industry-level attention depends on either outsiders holding the industry accountable for the event, or insiders' internal concerns with the industry image. We further infer that an event can be transformed into a critical issue for an industry, warranting sustained attention, if there is contestation with outsiders over the accountability for the event and its enactment, and internal contradictions and challenges to the industry's identity.},

	abstract = {When a serious failure occurs within a population of organizations, members of individual organizations in the population attempt to learn vicariously from the event so that future failures may be avoided. This organization-level vicarious learning process has been extensively studied in the organizational learning literature. However, following a serious failure in one organization, a parallel process also plays out at the population level as population-level actors draw lessons from the failure and exert influence over organizations in the population in the interest of preventing future failures. Such population-level processes may exert powerful influences on organization-level learning, but have only begun to be explored in the literature. This paper begins to fill this gap by theorizing and studying the role of population-level actors in organizational learning from failure within and across organizational populations. It examines these issues in a global sample of large airlines operating between 1981 and 2011. The findings indicate that population-level forces are a major driver of improvement and learning in members of organizational populations-specifically, that the monitoring strength and activity of population-level actors influence the rates of organizational learning from failure within their populations.},

	abstract = {Empirical investigations of decision making indicate that the level of individual or organizational risk taking is responsive to a risk taker's changing fortune. Several nonstationary random-walk models of risk taking are developed to describe this phenomenon. The models portray a risk taker's history as the cumulated realizations of a series of independent draws from a normal probability distribution of possible outcomes. This performance distribution is assumed to have an unchanging mean and a variance (risk) that changes. The changes are seen as determined by (a) a focus of attention on 1 of 2 reference points (an adaptive aspiration for resources and the survival point) and (b) the relation between current resources and the focal point. The models are elaborated by examining the impact of adaptive aspirations and attention focus on risk taking over time in a cohort of risk takers and in a renewing population of risk takers.},

Collective organizational wrongdoing involves the sustained coordination of multiple organizational participants.

We then provide an overview of an alternative explanation of collective wrongdoing, the process model of collective corruption. This sets the stage for our main contribution-a five part extension of the process model of collective corruption. Our investigation proceeds through a series of analyses, each of which begins with an elaboration of existing ideas about collective organizational wrongdoing, proceeds to an extension of these ideas, and concludes with an illustration of the extension. Our illustrations are drawn from case studies that include thick descriptions of organizational wrongdoing, which provide detailed information about the actions, thoughts, and emotions of wrongdoers as they become involved in wrongdoing.

We complement this line of work by exploring how scandals durably affect competition within a field, translating into relative advantages for certain organizations over others. First, scandals may benefit organizations that provide a close substitute to the offerings of the implicated organization. Second, scandals pave the way for moralizing discourses and practices, shake taken-for-granted assumptions about the conduct of organizations, and result in a shift in criteria used to evaluate organizations within the field. Our arguments suggest that organizations whose offerings are most similar to those of the implicated organization, yet are perceived as enforcing stricter standards of conduct, are likely to benefit the most from a scandal. We find support for these arguments in a county-level study of membership in the Catholic Church and 16 other Christian denominations in the United States in the wake of a series of sex abuse cases perpetrated by Catholic clergy between 1971 and 2000. This study contributes to our understanding of the competitive effects of scandals on organizations, and carries important implications for the management of organizations in scandal-stricken fields.},

Analyzing the U.S. film industry from 1945 to 1960, we examine how artists' employment in feature films was influenced by their associations with co-workers who were blacklisted as communists after working with the focal artist. Mere association reduces an artist's chances of working again, and one exposure is enough to impair work prospects. Furthermore, actors' careers are impaired when writers with whom they worked are blacklisted. Moreover, the negative effects of stigma by mere association hold even when the focal artist has received public acclaim. These findings have broad implications. When a few individuals or organizations are engaged in wrongdoing and publicly targeted, stigma by association can lead to false positives and harm many innocents. {\textcopyright} American Sociological Association 2010.},

Among them, the consequences of wrongdoing are widespread for organizations and the people in and around them. Due to the vast array of consequences, there continues to be new questions and additional scholarly attempts to uncover why it occurs. In this review, we build upon previous efforts to synthesize the body of literature regarding the antecedents of CEO wrongdoing utilizing a framework that sheds light on the status of the literature and where unanswered questions remain. We apply the Fraud Triangle, a framework drawn from the accounting literature, to derive conclusions about what we know about the pressures faced by CEOs, the opportunities afforded to CEOs to commit wrongdoing, and contributing factors to a CEO's ability to rationalize misbehavior. We organize the literature on these conceptual antecedents of CEO wrongdoing around internal (e.g., compensation structure and organizational culture) and external (e.g., shareholder pressure and social aspirations) forces. In doing so, we integrate findings from a variety of disciplines (i.e., accounting, finance, and sociology) but remain focused on management scholarship since the last review of organizational wrongdoing to provide an updated state of the literature. This review offers a clear framework and a common language; it highlights gaps in the literature and specific directions for future research with the ultimate goal of understanding why CEOs engage in wrongdoing.},

@article{Weick1999,
	abstract = {Argues that High Reliability Organizations (HROs) are central to the mainstream because they provide a unique window into organizational effectiveness under trying conditions. HROs enact a set of cognitive processes directed at proxies for failure, tendencies to simplify, sensitivity to operations, capabilities for resilience, and temptations to overstructure the system. Taken together these processes induce a state of collective mindfulness that creates a rich awareness of discriminatory detail and facilitates the discovery and correction of errors capable of escalation into catastrophe. These processes are not unique since they are a dormant infrastructure for process improvement in all organizations. Analysis of HROs suggests that inertia is not indigenous to organizing, that routines are effective because of their variation, and that learning may be a byproduct of mindfulness.
