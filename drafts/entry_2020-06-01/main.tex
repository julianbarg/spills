	What do organizations learn? Organizations learn with purpose. When an organization makes a new product, and this product does not sell well, the lesson learned may be "we have tried making this product, and there is no interest from the general public for this product" [could potentially change this example with something sustainability-related]. Organizations are also hard-pressed to improve something that they cannot measure, usually in terms of hard numbers \footnote{hence the extensive discussion in the learning literature on rare events, near-failures, and near-misses}.
	
	One of the strongest streams of the learning literature has long been the discourse on learning curves. When plotting out input and output, one can observe how production lines ramp up production. The same learning effect has been demonstrated for a selected number of other vital metrics (Argote 2013). This research has been undertaken without raising the question of why organizations may be improving in these areas, and not in others. The publication bias has further prevented us to learn where learning did not take place. In summary--organizations do not know what they cannot measure; if they are able to measure it, but not to improve it, they may not bother to measure it; and if they are capable of measuring it and improving it, we still might not hear about it if they do not do so.
	
%	Organizational learning (broadly speaking) was first proposed by Cyert and March for one purpose: to explain successful organizational adaption under the limitation of individual bounded rationality (Cyert and March 1993). Broadly speaking, March observed that organizations were not intelligent, but that they also did not behave completely irrational. Their behavior follows some rules, and in a changing environment, they are able to adjust. Individual cognitive efforts did not accumulate in an omniscient rational system, but they also were not in vain.

%	The organizational learning literature was originally motivated by two separate observations. (1) Cyert and March explored how under conditions of bounded rationality, organizations could adapt to the environment. They concluded that firms routinely make small, predetermined changes to

%	March observed that the theory of rationality [what would be a more precise term?] did not hold, and instead turned to bounded rationality. His initial conceptualization of organizational learning was an attempt to reconcile bounded rationality and organizational intelligence \citep{March1975}. (2) The second observation was made by \citet{Wright1936}--he noticed that with increasing production quantities, production cost would fall, and approach a specific value. Later, this discovery would come to be called the learning curve.
