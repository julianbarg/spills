	How do organizations choose what to learn? Organizational learning is more likely to occur when there is purpose to or a motivation for it. When there is a positive feedback to an effort, organizations are more likely to pursue it further. Organizations are also hard-pressed to improve something that they cannot measure, usually in terms of hard numbers \footnote{hence the extensive discussion in the learning literature on rare events, near-failures, and near-misses}.
	
	One of the most prolific streams of the learning literature until the 1990s been the discourse on learning curves. When plotting out input and output, one can observe that factories improve productivity over time. The same learning effect has been demonstrated for a selected number of other important metrics (Argote 2013). Are there things that organizations cannot learn? The literature on organizational learning does not give a direct answer to that question--where there is no learning, there is nothing to report in this stream of research. The behavioral stream on organizational research suggests three mechanisms: (1) organizations do not know what they cannot measure; (2) if they are able to measure it, but not to improve it, they may not bother to measure it; and (3) if they are capable of measuring it and improving it, we still might not hear about it if they do not do so.
	
	By addressing this topic, we hope to initiate a discourse on some of the basic assumptions of the learning literature. The learning literature has made great strides since scholars first started to theorize on the topic (Cyert and March 1963). We know have models available of knowledge generation, transfer, [list some examples of theorizing on a micro or meso scale]. The examples in the opening paragraph indicate that there are also some limits to organizational learning. A behavioral theory of organizational learning can provide some general insights on limitations to organizational learning, what is being learned, and what larger trends we can expect.
	
	\section{Organizational learning under conditions of bounded rationality}
	
	
	
%	Organizational learning (broadly speaking) was first proposed by Cyert and March for one purpose: to explain successful organizational adaption under the limitation of individual bounded rationality (Cyert and March 1993). Broadly speaking, March observed that organizations were not intelligent, but that they also did not behave completely irrational. Their behavior follows some rules, and in a changing environment, they are able to adjust. Individual cognitive efforts did not accumulate in an omniscient rational system, but they also were not in vain.

%	The organizational learning literature was originally motivated by two separate observations. (1) Cyert and March explored how under conditions of bounded rationality, organizations could adapt to the environment. They concluded that firms routinely make small, predetermined changes to

%	March observed that the theory of rationality [what would be a more precise term?] did not hold, and instead turned to bounded rationality. His initial conceptualization of organizational learning was an attempt to reconcile bounded rationality and organizational intelligence \citep{March1975}. (2) The second observation was made by \citet{Wright1936}--he noticed that with increasing production quantities, production cost would fall, and approach a specific value. Later, this discovery would come to be called the learning curve.
