	\section{}	
	Organizational learning found learning everywhere. But it was never really specified where we would expect learning to be. Despite attempts to simplify organizations, they never really pursue only one goal. How does marketing, operations, and R\&D contribute to profit? They take different approaches, and these three goals are pursued to different degrees. These goals are substitutes for the chosen overarching goals, and they can actively conflict.
	
	Put sustainability in the section of implications in conclusion--what does this mean for other areas, for instance sustainability? They are not going to learn it, unless there is a reason. If it is just one of many, they are also possibly not going to learn it.
