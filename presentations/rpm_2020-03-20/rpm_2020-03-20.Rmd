## Purpose

My previous analyses focused mostly on incident counts and extends of pipeline networks. But both pipeline incidents and networks are heterogeneous. Many questions I received at the PhD Research Series focused on how much oil was being spilled, and whether leaks were being contained. Therefore, I now obtained data on both the amount of oil transported (in barrel-miles) and on the amount of oil spilled.

The primary purpose will be to establish whether there are any big trends on learning or not. Where are improvements being made, where are not improvements?

## Volume estimates

Prior to 2010, the PHMSA does not differentiate betwen on and offshroe pipeline miles. They do however provide separate columns on what volume is transported onshore and offshore. For the purpose of this inquiry, I constructed columns which contain the actual values for 2010 onward (or where available) and an approximation for other values. The approximation takes the value of the share of offshore (or onshore) to total pipeline miles multiplied by the total volume transported.

$v_{est\_off} = \frac{miles_{off}}{miles_{on} + miles_{off}} * v_{total}$

The comparison shows that the uptick in volume transported is much more significant than that in pipeline miles. Existing pipelines are used to transport more oil, or pipelines with larger diameters are used, supposedly because of the fracking boom.

Obviously, this initially looks promising - with the volume being transported increasing, the volume of oil being spilled stays constant.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
A look at the row offshore immediately reveals a weakness of the dataset: The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is not captured, because this spill occured directly at the source.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
Further, the comperison of the three rows reveals that overall, offshore is just a small drop in the bucket. The trends are somewhat parallel (except for the year 2004 for offshore), and onshore far outscales offshore.

There is also a spike in 2009: Kalamazoo River oil spill - second largest in history.

The Taylor platform used to belong to BP, so it seems likely that the same event also damaged a pipeline of BP in the area.

There are more Highly Volatile Liquids (HVL) being transported without so much new pipelines being constructed. In contrast, modest increases in crude transported correspond to many new pipeline miles being constructed.

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}} -->
## What is the scale of performance difference between commoditites?
<!-- #endregion -->

Does safety performance converge?

```{r slideshow={'slide_type': 'skip'}}
options(repr.plot.width=8, repr.plot.height=3.5)
```

```{r slideshow={'slide_type': 'subslide'}}
pipelines_y_c %>%
    filter(variable == "volume_per_volume") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value)) + 
        facet_wrap(~commodity) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        labs(y = "Gallons of oil spilled per gallon-mile transported")
```

The divergence in scale might be explained by difference in density. Only for crude is learning obvious.

```{r slideshow={'slide_type': 'subslide'}}
pipelines_y_c %>%
    filter(variable == "cost_per_volume") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value)) + 
        facet_wrap(~commodity) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        labs(y = "Property damage in USD per gallon-mile transported")
```

Only crude incures noteworthy cost. Likely corresponds to legal cost, too. Maybe the motivation for improvements.

```{r slideshow={'slide_type': 'skip'}}
cost_graph <- pipelines_y_c %>%
    filter(variable == "cost_per_volume") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=year, y=value)) + 
        facet_wrap(~commodity) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        labs(y = "Cost of damage by oil spills in USD per gallon-mile transported") +
        scale_y_log10() +
        labs(title = "!!! Cost - log scaled !!!")
```

```{r slideshow={'slide_type': 'subslide'}}
cost_graph
```

Log scale reveals that there is a cost difference betweden HVL and RPP after all. Maybe explaining why there is less improvements for HVL than for RPP.

## Summary
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}} -->
There are different trends for different commodities, and organizations are in different stages of experience with different commodities. These commodities correspond to different, but related technologies. I want to exploit this heterogeneity of technologies and experience for my research. There are also differences between onshore and offshore, but they are not as pronounced as those between commodities. So I might not persue those further, or only superficially. I will focus on onshore.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}} -->
In terms of variables, I will probably volume transported (in gallon-miles) more accurately catpures activities. There are some limitations on data availability, but I can cope with those challenges. However, when standardizing by volume being transported, an increase in volume being transported can mask that the same pipeline is experiencing a constant, or growing error rate. The pipelines would appear to become "safer" relative to volume being transported.
